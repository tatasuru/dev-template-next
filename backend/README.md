# Getting Started

for example, we start to develop `order_customization` api.

## generate folder and necessary stuff

```sh
nest g resource order_customization
```

```sh
? What transport layer do you use? (Use arrow keys) ❯ REST API
? Would you like to generate CRUD entry points? ❯ Yes
```

this command creates entity, service, controller and so on...

## 1 implement entity and model

first of all, we start to implement these.

## 2 implement service file

## 3 implement controller file
